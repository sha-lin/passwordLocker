## Description

Password Locker is an application that helps users to generate accounts and generate secure passwords for them . The password locker runs on the terminal and uses short codes to navigate through it. When starting up the application, the user is met with the following shortcodes:

1. sh - Sign up for an account
2. ac - Sign in to your account
3. da - display all the accounts the user has
3. Ex - Exit the application


##  Guide to Use App
    First the app wil ask you to choose to create an account or to continue with an existing accounts
    and can follow the process according to what you want to do.

##  BDD
    -   Your project should have two classes, a User class and Credentials class.
    -   Your application should have an authentication system that enables a user to log into their account and view their credentials. A user should be able to login to their account using the password that they created and NOT any password.
    -   Your project should make use of doc strings to document methods and functions.
    -   Your project must have a test class that test each individual method in your classes.
